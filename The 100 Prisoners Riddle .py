# There are 100 prisoners with numbers 1-100. 100 boxes are placed in a room with a number 1-100 in each of the boxes. The prisoners go in one by one and search 50 boxes.
# If all 100 are able to find their box within 50 tries, they all escape prison. If any of them fail to find their number, they all die.
# As iterations increase, the outcome to this problem approaches 1 - ln2 â‰ˆ 0.30685 or 30.685%
